//! Executor â€” orchestration of runtime execution and rate control
//!
//! The `Executor` trait is the runtime hook that executes a `Scenario`. Different
//! executors provide different execution strategies: sequential, concurrent,
//! distributed, or token-bucket-based.
//!
//! Karga provides a built-in [`StageExecutor`] which uses a token-bucket governor
//! driven by a list of [`Stage`]s to control the request rate.
