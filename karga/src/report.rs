/// A [`Report`] represents the processed form of an [`Aggregate`].
///
/// Reports transform raw aggregated data into meaningful insights — such as
/// averages, percentiles, ratios, and totals. They are *pure data structures*, free
/// of side effects and I/O, and should encapsulate only the logic needed to derive
/// final, human- or machine-readable results.
///
/// Implementors must define how to construct the report from an [`Aggregate`], typically
/// via a [`From<A>`] implementation. Once created, a report can be serialized, logged,
/// or consumed by a [`Reporter`].
///
/// # Design goals
/// - **Purity:** reports contain no I/O; they are deterministic data transformations.
/// - **Serializability:** all reports must implement [`Serialize`] and [`DeserializeOwned`].
/// - **Composability:** the same aggregate type can feed multiple report implementations
///   with different analytical focuses.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// use karga::{Aggregate, Report};
/// use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
/// struct MyReport {
///     average_latency: Duration,
/// }
/// # struct MyAggregate { total_latency: Duration, count: usize }
/// impl From<MyAggregate> for MyReport {
///     fn from(a: MyAggregate) -> Self {
///         Self { average_latency: a.total_latency / a.count as u32 }
///     }
/// }
/// impl Report<MyAggregate> for MyReport {}
/// ```
///
/// # Feature flags
/// - `builtins`: includes [`BasicReport`], a ready-to-use implementation derived
///   from [`BasicAggregate`](crate::aggregate::BasicAggregate).
///
/// See also: [`Reporter`].
